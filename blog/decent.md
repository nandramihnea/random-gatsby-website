This isn't a easy question for sure.
In few words, it means almost **everything**.

It means
* freedom
* self-governence
* a life worth living

your spirit is a world worth living in.

A world where **physical money**, **centralized banks**,
**governments**, **political parties** start being obsolete,
is a world that Sir John Lennon ... imagined
